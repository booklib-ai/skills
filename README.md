Book-grounded AI agent skills — each skill packages expert practices from a canonical programming book into reusable instructions that Claude and other AI agents can apply to code generation, code review, and design decisions.

```bash
npx skills add booklib-ai/skills
```

![Demo](demo.gif)

Each skill is a self-contained folder with a `SKILL.md` file containing instructions and metadata that AI agents use to perform specialized tasks.

## Structure

```
booklib-ai/skills (repo root)
├── skills/
│   ├── clean-code-reviewer/
│   │   ├── SKILL.md          # Required
│   │   ├── examples/

## Skill Format

Each skill follows the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io):

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required — YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions
├── scripts/          # Optional — deterministic code for repeated tasks
├── references/       # Optional — docs loaded into context as needed
├── assets/           # Optional — templates, fonts, images
└── evals/            # Optional — test cases for skill evaluation
```

## Installation

### via skills CLI (recommended)

```bash
# Install all skills globally
npx skills add booklib-ai/skills --all -g

# Install a specific skill
npx skills add booklib-ai/skills --skill effective-kotlin

# List available skills without installing
npx skills add booklib-ai/skills --list
```

### via npm

```bash
# Install all skills globally
npx @booklib/skills add --all --global

# Install a single skill
npx @booklib/skills add effective-kotlin

# List available skills
npx @booklib/skills list
```

Skills are installed to `.claude/skills/` in your project (or `~/.claude/skills/` with `--global`).

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/booklib-ai/skills.git
cp -r booklib-ai-skills/skills/effective-kotlin /path/to/project/.claude/skills/
```

## Automatic Skill Routing

You don't need to know which skill to apply — the **[skill-router](./skills/skill-router/)** meta-skill does it for you.

When an AI agent receives a task, it can invoke `skill-router` first to identify the 1–2 most relevant skills based on the file, language, domain, and work type. The router then returns a ranked recommendation with rationale, so the right expertise is applied automatically.

```
User: "Review my order processing service"

→ skill-router selects:
   Primary:   domain-driven-design   — domain model design (Aggregates, Value Objects)
   Secondary: microservices-patterns — service boundaries and inter-service communication
   Skip:      clean-code-reviewer    — premature at design stage; apply later on implementation code
```

This means skills compose: `skill-router` acts as an orchestrator that picks the right specialist skills for the context, without requiring the user to know the library upfront.
