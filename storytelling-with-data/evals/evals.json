        "Identifies pie/donut charts as inappropriate for comparing 8 categories — human perception cannot accurately compare angles or arc lengths, especially for similar-sized slices like 9%, 5%, 4%, 2%",
        "Recommends replacing the pie chart with a horizontal bar chart ordered by value — this makes comparison trivially easy and is the explicit recommendation from Storytelling with Data Ch 2",
        "Flags that 8 different colors violates the principle of purposeful color use — color should highlight the data point that matters, not differentiate all 8 categories",
        "Flags the generic, descriptive title 'Website Traffic by Source' — per Ch 7, the title should state the actionable takeaway (e.g., 'Organic and Direct together drive half of all traffic — paid channels underperform')",
        "Notes that forcing the audience to cross-reference a legend for 8 items adds unnecessary cognitive load — direct labels on bars would be clearer",
        "Points out the context: this is for a decision about ad spend — the chart should make it obvious which channels to invest in or cut, not just show proportions",
        "May suggest greying out all bars except the ones relevant to the decision (e.g., Paid Search and Display Ads highlighted to show underperformance) to focus attention per Ch 4"

      "expectations": [
        "Identifies the 3D effect as a critical flaw: 3D distorts the visual representation of bar heights — the same bar appears different heights depending on viewing angle, making accurate comparison impossible (Ch 2 and Ch 3)",
        "Flags the 16-color palette as violating purposeful color use — with 4 regions × 4 quarters, either region or time should use color; the other should use position/grouping alone",
        "Flags the heavy gridlines as chart junk (Ch 3): dark 1.5px gridlines compete with the data; if gridlines are needed, they should be very light grey (~#e5e7eb) and thin (0.5px)",
        "Flags the blue gradient background as chart junk — plot area backgrounds add noise without adding information; white or no background is correct",
        "Flags the chart border/drop shadow as chart junk — borders around charts imply the chart needs to be 'contained' and add visual noise",
        "Flags the rotated Y-axis title — violates the alignment principle (Ch. 5: Think Like a Designer — left-align text for readability; rotated/vertical text is harder to read and should be made horizontal or removed)",
        "Notes the data labels show '$125,432.00' — excessive decimal precision is visual clutter with no informational value at this scale; '$125K' is clearer (Ch. 3: Eliminate Clutter; data-ink ratio — maximize the proportion of ink devoted to actual data)",
        "Notes the overlapping legend is a usability problem — direct labeling of regions on the chart would eliminate the need for a legend entirely",
        "Recommends: remove 3D, use flat 2D bars; remove gridlines or make them very light; white background; consistent color scheme (one color per region); direct labels; action-oriented title"
