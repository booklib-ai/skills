# Storytelling with Data — Visualization Review Checklist

Systematic checklist for reviewing data visualizations against the 6 lessons
from *Storytelling with Data* by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic.

---

## 1. Context (Ch 1)

- [ ] **Ch 1 — Audience defined** — Is the target audience clearly identified?
- [ ] **Ch 1 — Action specified** — Is there a specific action the audience should take?
- [ ] **Ch 1 — Mechanism appropriate** — Is the delivery method (presentation, report, email, dashboard) suited to the message?
- [ ] **Ch 1 — Explanatory focus** — Is this communicating ONE insight, not exploring all the data?
- [ ] **Ch 1 — Big Idea articulated** — Can the message be stated in one sentence with a point of view and stakes?
- [ ] **Ch 1 — 3-Minute Story passes** — Could someone retell this in 3 minutes at a coffee machine?

## 2. Chart Type (Ch 2)

- [ ] **Ch 2 — Right visual chosen** — Does the chart type match the data relationship (time→line, categories→bar, relationship→scatter)?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — No pie/donut charts** — Are pie/donut charts avoided (use horizontal bar instead)?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — No 3D effects** — Are all charts flat 2D with no 3D distortion?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — No secondary y-axis** — Are dual y-axes avoided (use two separate charts)?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — Bar charts start at zero** — Do all bar charts have a zero baseline?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — Simple text for 1–2 numbers** — Are standalone metrics shown as large text, not charts?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — Tables for lookup only** — Are tables used only when precise values are needed, not in live presentations?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — Bars ordered meaningfully** — Are bar charts ordered by value (or natural order), not alphabetically?

---

## 3. Clutter (Ch 3)

- [ ] **Ch 3 — Chart borders removed** — Are unnecessary chart borders/outlines eliminated?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Gridlines minimal** — Are gridlines removed or very light grey?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Data markers removed** — Are unnecessary data markers on line charts eliminated?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Axis cleaned** — Are unnecessary tick marks, axis lines, and axis titles removed?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Direct labels used** — Are data series labeled directly rather than using a legend?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Precision appropriate** — Are numbers rounded to meaningful precision (not excessive decimals)?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Background clean** — Is the background white or very light neutral?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — White space present** — Is there adequate breathing room (not crammed)?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Gestalt applied** — Is proximity, similarity, or enclosure used to show grouping?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Data-ink ratio high** — Does most of the visual's "ink" represent data, not decoration?

---

## 4. Attention (Ch 4)

- [ ] **Ch 4 — Color used sparingly** — Is color limited to 1–2 accent colors (not rainbow)?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Grey-first approach** — Is most data grey with only the key story highlighted in color?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Eyes drawn correctly** — Does the "where are your eyes drawn?" test pass?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Preattentive attributes used** — Are size, color, bold, or position used to guide attention?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Color consistent** — Does the same color mean the same thing across all visuals?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Color not sole indicator** — Is information available without relying on color alone (accessibility)?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Annotations present** — Are key data points annotated with text explaining significance?

---

## 5. Design (Ch 5)

- [ ] **Ch 5 — Text left-aligned** — Is text left-aligned (not centered) for readability?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Numbers right-aligned** — Are numbers in tables/columns right-aligned?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Visual hierarchy clear** — Is the title/takeaway most prominent, then data, then supporting elements?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Alignment clean** — Are chart elements aligned on a consistent grid?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — White space deliberate** — Are margins and padding used intentionally?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Consistency maintained** — Are colors, fonts, and chart styles consistent across all visuals?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Aesthetics polished** — Does the visual look professional and credible?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Accessible** — Is the visual readable for color-blind users and in black-and-white?

---

## 6. Story (Ch 7)

- [ ] **Ch 7 — Action title used** — Does each chart title state a takeaway (not a label)?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Horizontal logic works** — Do the slide/section titles alone tell a complete story?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Vertical logic works** — Does everything on each slide/page support its title?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Three-act structure** — Is there a clear setup → conflict → resolution arc?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Call to action present** — Does the presentation end with a specific, actionable recommendation?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — "So what?" answered** — Is the significance of each data point explained?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Big Idea repeated** — Is the core message stated at the beginning, reinforced in the middle, and restated at the end?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Narrative flow logical** — Does the sequence of visuals build a coherent argument?

## Quick Review Workflow

1. **Context pass** — Is the audience, action, and Big Idea clear?
2. **Chart type pass** — Is each visual the right type for the data? Any pie charts or 3D?
3. **Clutter pass** — What can be removed? Borders, gridlines, markers, legend, decorations?
4. **Attention pass** — Squint test: where do your eyes go? Is that the right place?
5. **Design pass** — Alignment, white space, consistency, hierarchy all clean?
6. **Story pass** — Read only the titles: do they tell a compelling, complete narrative?
7. **Prioritize findings** — Context > Chart Type > Attention > Clutter > Story > Design polish

## Title Quality Check

| Title Type | Example | Quality |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **No title** | (blank) | Unacceptable |
| **Label title** | "Q3 Revenue by Region" | Poor — describes but doesn't inform |
| **Observation title** | "Q3 revenue varied across regions" | Mediocre — vague observation |
| **Action title** | "Northeast Q3 revenue dropped 18% — investigate staffing gaps" | Excellent — takeaway + implication |

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Misleading or unreadable | Wrong chart type distorting data; bar chart not starting at zero; unreadable text; no title |
| **High** | Missing context or wrong focus | No Big Idea; rainbow colors with no focal point; no annotations; legend instead of direct labels |
| **Medium** | Clutter or inconsistency | Unnecessary gridlines/borders; inconsistent colors; excessive decimals; cluttered default styling |
| **Low** | Polish or narrative | Label title instead of action title; minor alignment issues; missing white space; weak narrative flow |
