# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Skills in this repository are markdown instruction files — they contain no executable code that runs on install. However, if you discover a skill that contains malicious instructions or attempts to exfiltrate data, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue.** Instead, report security concerns via [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/booklib-ai/skills/security/advisories/new).

We will respond within 48 hours and issue a fix promptly.
