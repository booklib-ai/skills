Complete chapter-by-chapter catalog of practices from *The Lean Startup*
by Eric Ries.

## Part One: VISION

### Chapter 1: Start

#### Entrepreneurship Is Management
- Startups require management — but a different kind than established companies
- Traditional management (forecasting, milestones, detailed plans) fails under extreme uncertainty
- The Lean Startup methodology provides a disciplined approach to entrepreneurship
- Success is not about the right idea; it's about the right process for discovering what works

#### The Five Principles
1. **Entrepreneurs are everywhere** — Not just garage startups; anyone creating under extreme uncertainty
2. **Entrepreneurship is management** — A startup is an institution that needs to be managed
3. **Validated learning** — Startups learn what works through scientific experimentation
4. **Build-Measure-Learn** — The fundamental feedback loop of turning ideas into products
5. **Innovation accounting** — Boring stuff matters: measuring progress, setting milestones, prioritizing work

---

### Chapter 2: Define

#### What Is a Startup?
- **Definition** — A human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty
- **Three components**: Institution (people, organization), Product (broadly defined, including the experience), Extreme uncertainty (the key differentiator)
- Startups exist within large companies too — intrapreneurs face the same challenges

#### The Snaptax Story
- Intuit's internal startup team used lean principles within a large enterprise
- Small team, rapid iteration, validated learning with real customers
- Demonstrates that lean startup works inside established organizations

---

### Chapter 3: Learn

#### Validated Learning
- **Core concept** — Learning that is backed by empirical data from real customer experiments
- **Not just "we learned a lot"** — Must demonstrate concrete evidence of validated, actionable insights
- **Value vs. waste** — Any effort not directed toward learning what customers want is waste
- **The IMVU story** — Built IM add-on, launched quickly, learned customers wanted standalone product; every feature they thought was essential turned out to be wrong

#### How to Validate
- Run experiments with real customers, not focus groups or surveys alone
- Measure actual behavior, not stated preferences
- Use the scientific method: hypothesis → experiment → measurement → learning
- Validated learning is more reliable than market research or theoretical planning

#### Auditing Learning
- Ask: "What did we learn?" after every effort
- If you can't point to specific validated learnings, you may be producing waste
- Learning milestones replace traditional milestones in a startup context

---

### Chapter 4: Experiment

#### Strategy as Experiment
- Every strategic plan contains assumptions — treat them as hypotheses to test
- Don't just plan; experiment
- The Zappos example: tested demand for online shoes by posting shoe photos and buying from retail stores when orders came in — zero inventory risk

#### Designing Experiments
- **Clear hypothesis** — "We believe [customer segment] will [take action] because [reason]"
- **Measurable outcome** — Define success/failure criteria upfront
- **Minimum effort** — Design the smallest experiment that tests the hypothesis
- **Real customer interaction** — Test with actual customers, not internal stakeholders

#### Government and NGO Applications
- Lean Startup principles apply beyond commercial startups
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau used lean principles for government services
- Any situation with uncertainty benefits from validated learning

---

## Part Two: STEER

### Chapter 5: Leap

#### Leap-of-Faith Assumptions
- **Every business plan has assumptions** — The most important are the ones that, if wrong, doom the venture
- **Value hypothesis** — Does the product deliver value to customers? Will they use/pay for it?
- **Growth hypothesis** — How will new customers discover the product? Will growth be sustainable?
- **Analog and antilog** — Look at analogous successes (analogs) and failures (antilogs) to ground assumptions

#### Genchi Gembutsu (Go and See)
- Toyota principle: go see the problem firsthand
- Talk to customers directly; don't rely on reports and surveys alone
- Customer archetype development through direct observation
- Understand customer needs at a deep level before building solutions

#### Strategy and Assumptions
- Strategy is built on assumptions — make them explicit
- Test assumptions in order of riskiness — most dangerous first
- Don't waste time building features based on untested assumptions

---

### Chapter 6: Test

#### The Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- **Definition** — The version of a product that allows a full turn of the Build-Measure-Learn loop with minimum effort
- **Purpose** — To test fundamental business hypotheses, not to build a small product
- **It will feel incomplete** — If your first product doesn't embarrass you, you launched too late

#### Types of MVPs
- **Video MVP** — Dropbox created a demo video explaining the product; measured signup interest before building
- **Concierge MVP** — Manually deliver the service to a handful of customers; learn before automating
- **Wizard of Oz MVP** — Looks automated to customers, but humans are doing the work behind the scenes
- **Landing page MVP** — Single page describing the product; measure signups or clicks to gauge interest
- **Smoke test** — Sell the product before building it; measure actual purchase intent

#### Quality and MVP
- **Remove any feature/process/effort that doesn't contribute to the learning you seek**
- Quality in MVP context means: quality of learning, not quality of product
- Customers may complain about MVP quality — that's data, not failure
- Professional customers and early adopters have different quality expectations
- Early adopters want solutions to problems; they'll tolerate imperfections

#### MVP Fears
- **Competitors will steal the idea** — Speed of iteration matters more than secrecy; if competitors can out-execute on your idea that easily, you have bigger problems
- **Brand damage** — Launch MVP under a different brand if needed; early adopters don't define your brand
- **Discouragement from negative results** — Negative results are learning; the only failure is not learning

### Chapter 7: Measure

#### Innovation Accounting
- **Three steps**: (1) Establish baseline with MVP, (2) Tune the engine toward the ideal, (3) Pivot or persevere
- **Baseline** — MVP establishes where the company actually stands on key metrics
- **Tuning** — Each iteration attempts to improve metrics from baseline toward business plan goals
- **Decision** — If tuning isn't working, it's time to pivot

#### Actionable vs. Vanity Metrics
- **Vanity metrics** — Total signups, total revenue, page views — look good but don't inform decisions
- **Actionable metrics** — Cohort analysis, per-customer metrics, conversion rates — drive specific actions
- **Three A's of good metrics**: Actionable (shows cause and effect), Accessible (everyone understands), Auditable (can verify the data)

#### Cohort Analysis
- Group customers by when they joined (cohort), not cumulative totals
- Compare cohorts to see if product changes actually improve metrics
- Example: Are customers acquired this month retaining better than last month's?

#### Split Testing (A/B Testing)
- Test product changes with controlled experiments
- Show different versions to different customer groups simultaneously
- Measure the actual impact of each change on customer behavior
- Avoid "launch and hope" — test and learn instead

#### Kanban with Validation
- Modified kanban: features progress through stages including "validated"
- A feature isn't done until it's been tested with customers and learning is captured
- Limits work-in-progress to maintain focus on learning

---

### Chapter 8: Pivot (or Persevere)

#### The Pivot Decision
- **Structured decision** — Not panic, not ego; data-driven through innovation accounting
- **Runway = number of pivots remaining** — Not just cash in the bank; time and pivots left
- **Regular pivot meetings** — Schedule them (e.g., monthly); don't wait for crisis
- **Telltale signs you need to pivot**: Experiments yield diminishing results, product development feels unproductive, feeling that the engine isn't working

#### Catalog of Pivots
- **Zoom-in pivot** — A single feature becomes the whole product
- **Zoom-out pivot** — The whole product becomes a feature of something larger
- **Customer segment pivot** — Same product, different target customer
- **Customer need pivot** — Same customer, different problem to solve
- **Platform pivot** — Change from application to platform (or vice versa)
- **Business architecture pivot** — Switch between high margin/low volume and low margin/high volume
- **Value capture pivot** — Change how you monetize (subscription, ads, transaction fee, etc.)
- **Engine of growth pivot** — Switch between viral, sticky, or paid growth
- **Channel pivot** — Change distribution channel (direct, retail, online, etc.)
- **Technology pivot** — Achieve the same solution using different technology

#### Pivot Success Stories
- Wealthfront pivoted from game-based stock picking to automated investment management
- Votizen pivoted through four models before finding what worked
- Each pivot preserved what was learned while changing what wasn't working

## Part Three: ACCELERATE

### Chapter 9: Batch

#### Small Batches
- **Single-piece flow** — Complete each item fully before starting the next; counterintuitive but faster
- **The envelope-stuffing example** — Folding all letters, then stuffing all envelopes is slower than doing each letter end-to-end
- **Why small batches win**: Find quality problems sooner, reduce work-in-progress, enable faster learning loops

#### Continuous Deployment
- **Ship every change immediately** — Don't batch up releases
- **IMVU example** — Deployed 50+ times per day; immune system of automated tests
- **Andon cord** — Stop the production line when a defect is found; fix it immediately
- **Benefits**: Faster feedback, smaller blast radius for bugs, continuous learning

#### Pull, Don't Push
- **Pull system** — Only build what's needed by the next step in the process
- **Just-in-time production** — Applied to software: only build features when validated learning demands them
- **Avoid inventory** — Unvalidated features are inventory; they have carrying costs

---

### Chapter 10: Grow

#### Engines of Growth
- **Sticky engine** — Retain existing customers; growth = new customers > churned customers
  - Key metric: customer retention rate / churn rate
  - Strategy: improve product to increase retention
  - Example: subscription businesses, SaaS
- **Viral engine** — Existing customers bring new customers as a side effect of usage
  - Key metric: viral coefficient (must be >1 for viral growth)
  - Strategy: make sharing/inviting natural to product usage
  - Example: social networks, communication tools (Hotmail signature, PayPal referrals)
- **Paid engine** — Spend money to acquire customers; growth = LTV > CAC
  - Key metric: customer lifetime value (LTV) minus cost of acquisition (CAC)
  - Strategy: increase LTV or decrease CAC
  - Example: advertising-driven businesses, enterprise sales

#### Choosing Your Engine
- **Focus on one engine at a time** — Rare to succeed at multiple simultaneously
- **Product/market fit** — When you find an engine that works, you'll know — metrics will spike
- **Sustainable growth** — New customers come from the actions of past customers (not one-time campaigns)

#### When Engines Run Out
- Every engine eventually exhausts its fuel (addressable market, viral networks, profitable channels)
- Companies need to manage growth engine transitions
- This is where established company innovation (Ch 12) becomes critical

### Chapter 11: Adapt

#### Five Whys
- **Root cause analysis** — Ask "why?" five times to get to the root of a problem
- **Proportional investment** — Invest proportionally to the severity; small problems get small fixes
- **How to apply**: Problem → Why? → Why? → Why? → Why? → Why? → Root cause → Proportional fix
- **Common pattern**: Technical problems often have human/process root causes
- **Avoid Five Blames** — Focus on systems and processes, not people

#### Building an Adaptive Organization
- **Speed regulators** — Five Whys acts as a natural speed regulator; problems slow you down until fixed
- **Training and process** — Invest in training when Five Whys reveals skill gaps
- **Tolerance for failure** — Build a culture that accepts mistakes as learning opportunities
- **Simplicity** — Start simple: pick one Five Whys area, run a session, implement the smallest fix

#### Getting Started with Five Whys
- Requires executive buy-in and a facilitator
- Start with a specific, narrow problem domain
- Be tolerant of first-time mistakes; the process improves with practice
- Ensure everyone affected by the problem is in the room

### Chapter 12: Innovate

#### Innovation Sandbox
- **Create a protected space** — Innovation teams need protection from the parent organization's processes
- **Boundaries**: Defined customer segment, limited scope, time-boxed experiments, small team
- **Team autonomy** — Cross-functional team with authority to build, market, and deploy within sandbox
- **Metrics-based accountability** — Innovation accounting inside the sandbox; standard metrics outside

#### Internal Startup Teams
- **Scarce but dedicated resources** — Small team fully devoted, not shared across projects
- **Independent development authority** — Can develop and deploy without organizational approvals
- **Reporting structure** — Report to senior leadership, not middle management layers
- **Personal stake** — Team members should have meaningful personal investment in the outcome

#### Protecting the Parent
- **Portfolio management** — Manage internal startups alongside core business
- **Handoff process** — When sandbox succeeds, integrate the innovation into the main organization
- **Culture clash** — Innovation team culture will differ from parent; manage the tension intentionally

#### Shusa (Chief Engineer) Concept
- Toyota's concept of a heavyweight project leader
- One person responsible for the complete customer experience
- Cuts across organizational silos to deliver integrated value

### Chapter 13: Epilogue — Waste Not

#### The Biggest Waste
- Building products nobody wants is the greatest waste in startups
- All the efficient processes in the world don't matter if you're building the wrong thing
- Lean Startup is about eliminating waste through validated learning

#### Connection to Lean Manufacturing
- Toyota Production System inspired the methodology
- Just-in-time, small batches, andon cord, continuous improvement (kaizen)
- Applied to product development: just-in-time learning, small experiment batches, stop-the-line for learning failures

#### Organizational Superpowers
- Companies that master validated learning have a structural advantage
- Speed of learning, not speed of production, is the competitive moat
- Every organization can adopt these practices regardless of size or industry

### Chapter 14: Join the Movement

#### The Lean Startup Movement
- Community of practice spanning industries and geographies
- Conferences, meetups, online resources for practitioners
- Lean Startup principles as organizational capability, not just a phase

#### Long-Term Vision
- Build organizations that can sustain innovation over decades
- Balance between exploiting current business and exploring new opportunities
- The goal is not one successful product but a learning organization
