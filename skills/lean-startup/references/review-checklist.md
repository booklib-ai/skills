# The Lean Startup — Strategy Review Checklist

Systematic checklist for reviewing startup/product strategies against the 14 chapters
from *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries.

---

## 1. Vision & Definition (Chapters 1–2)

### Startup Identity
- [ ] **Ch 1 — Startup management** — Is the venture managed as a startup (experimentation-based) rather than with traditional planning?
- [ ] **Ch 1 — Five principles awareness** — Are the five Lean Startup principles understood and applied?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — Uncertainty acknowledgment** — Is extreme uncertainty recognized as the defining condition?
- [ ] **Ch 2 — Institutional thinking** — Is the startup treated as an institution requiring management, not just a product?

---

## 2. Learning & Experimentation (Chapters 3–4)

### Validated Learning
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Learning measurement** — Can the team point to specific validated learnings from recent work?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Value vs. waste** — Is effort directed toward learning what customers want, or toward untested features?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Empirical evidence** — Are decisions based on customer experiment data, not opinions or surveys alone?
- [ ] **Ch 3 — Learning milestones** — Are learning milestones used instead of (or alongside) traditional milestones?

### Experiment Design
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Hypothesis-driven** — Are initiatives framed as testable hypotheses with clear success/failure criteria?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Minimum experiment** — Is each experiment the smallest possible test of the core assumption?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Real customers** — Are experiments run with actual customers, not internal stakeholders?
- [ ] **Ch 4 — Measurable outcomes** — Are success/failure criteria defined before the experiment runs?

---

## 3. Assumptions & MVP (Chapters 5–6)

### Leap-of-Faith Assumptions
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Assumptions identified** — Are the riskiest assumptions explicitly listed?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Value hypothesis** — Is there a clear value hypothesis (will customers use/pay for this)?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Growth hypothesis** — Is there a clear growth hypothesis (how will new customers discover this)?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Risk ordering** — Are assumptions tested in order of riskiness (most dangerous first)?
- [ ] **Ch 5 — Customer contact** — Is the team practicing genchi gembutsu (talking to customers directly)?

### MVP Design
- [ ] **Ch 6 — MVP purpose** — Is the MVP designed to test a hypothesis, not to be a small product?
- [ ] **Ch 6 — MVP type** — Is the right MVP type used (video, concierge, Wizard of Oz, landing page, smoke test)?
- [ ] **Ch 6 — Minimum scope** — Does the MVP contain only what's needed for the learning goal?
- [ ] **Ch 6 — Quality perspective** — Is MVP quality measured by learning quality, not product polish?
- [ ] **Ch 6 — Fear management** — Are fears (competitors, brand damage, discouragement) addressed rationally?

## 4. Metrics & Accounting (Chapter 7)

### Innovation Accounting
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Three-step process** — Is innovation accounting followed (baseline → tune → pivot/persevere)?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Baseline established** — Has the MVP established a baseline for key metrics?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Tuning measured** — Are iterations measured against the baseline to show improvement?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Decision readiness** — Is there enough data to make a pivot/persevere decision?

### Metric Quality
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Actionable metrics** — Are metrics actionable (show cause and effect), not vanity (total signups)?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Cohort analysis** — Are customers grouped by cohort, not measured as cumulative totals?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Split testing** — Are product changes tested with A/B tests, not "launch and hope"?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Three A's** — Are metrics Actionable, Accessible (everyone understands), and Auditable (verifiable)?
- [ ] **Ch 7 — Kanban with validation** — Are features tracked through a validation stage, not just "done"?

---

## 5. Pivot Decisions (Chapter 8)

### Decision Process
- [ ] **Ch 8 — Regular meetings** — Are pivot/persevere meetings scheduled regularly (not crisis-driven)?
- [ ] **Ch 8 — Data-driven** — Are pivot decisions based on innovation accounting data, not gut feelings?
- [ ] **Ch 8 — Runway awareness** — Is runway measured in pivots remaining, not just cash?
- [ ] **Ch 8 — Warning signs** — Are telltale signs monitored (diminishing experiment results, unproductive development)?

### Pivot Knowledge
- [ ] **Ch 8 — Pivot catalog** — Does the team know the full catalog of pivot types?
- [ ] **Ch 8 — Preserved learning** — Does each pivot preserve validated learning while changing what isn't working?
- [ ] **Ch 8 — No stigma** — Is pivoting treated as a strategic move, not a failure?

---

## 6. Execution & Growth (Chapters 9–10)

### Development Process
- [ ] **Ch 9 — Small batches** — Is work shipped in small batches, not large releases?
- [ ] **Ch 9 — Continuous deployment** — Are changes deployed frequently (daily or more)?
- [ ] **Ch 9 — Pull system** — Are features built only when validated learning demands them?
- [ ] **Ch 9 — Andon cord** — Is there a process to stop and fix quality issues immediately?

### Growth Strategy
- [ ] **Ch 10 — Engine identified** — Is the engine of growth identified (sticky, viral, or paid)?
- [ ] **Ch 10 — Engine focused** — Is the team focused on one engine at a time?
- [ ] **Ch 10 — Sustainable growth** — Does growth come from past customer actions, not one-time campaigns?
- [ ] **Ch 10 — Product/market fit** — Are key metrics spiking, indicating product/market fit?
- [ ] **Ch 10 — Engine monitoring** — Is the team watching for engine exhaustion and planning transitions?

---

## 7. Organization & Process (Chapters 11–12)

### Adaptive Process
- [ ] **Ch 11 — Five Whys** — Is Five Whys root cause analysis used for problems?
- [ ] **Ch 11 — Proportional investment** — Are fixes proportional to problem severity?
- [ ] **Ch 11 — No blame culture** — Does root cause analysis focus on systems, not people?
- [ ] **Ch 11 — Continuous improvement** — Is there a culture of learning from failures?

### Innovation Structure (for enterprises)
- [ ] **Ch 12 — Innovation sandbox** — Is there a protected space for innovation with clear boundaries?
- [ ] **Ch 12 — Dedicated team** — Is the innovation team small, cross-functional, and fully dedicated?
- [ ] **Ch 12 — Team autonomy** — Does the team have authority to build, deploy, and iterate independently?
- [ ] **Ch 12 — Parent protection** — Are mechanisms in place to protect the parent organization?
- [ ] **Ch 12 — Metrics accountability** — Is the innovation team held accountable with innovation accounting?

## Quick Review Workflow

1. **Vision pass** — Is the venture recognized as a startup? Is the right management approach used?
2. **Learning pass** — Is validated learning happening? Can the team point to evidence?
3. **Assumption pass** — Are leap-of-faith assumptions identified and tested in risk order?
4. **MVP pass** — Is the MVP testing a hypothesis? Is it the minimum needed?
5. **Metrics pass** — Are metrics actionable? Is innovation accounting in place?
6. **Decision pass** — Are pivot/persevere decisions structured, regular, and data-driven?
7. **Execution pass** — Are batches small? Is a growth engine identified and focused?
8. **Organization pass** — Is Five Whys used? Is innovation protected in enterprise context?
9. **Prioritize findings** — Rank by severity: wrong assumptions > wrong metrics > wrong process > nice-to-have

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Building on untested assumptions or wrong metrics | No value/growth hypothesis, vanity metrics as KPIs, no customer contact, building full product before testing assumptions |
| **High** | Missing core Lean Startup practices | No innovation accounting, no MVP experiments, gut-feel pivot decisions, no cohort analysis |
| **Medium** | Process and execution gaps | Big-batch releases, no split testing, no Five Whys, no regular pivot meetings, single growth engine not identified |
| **Low** | Best practice improvements | No kanban validation stage, no formal experiment documentation, no innovation sandbox for enterprise, missing pivot catalog awareness |
